What I do:
I am the center for edge feature extraction
What's my input:
qid,query,lDoc,lQObj,lDocObj
What's my output:
the features between any two
    call all edge feature extractors to complete the job
        maybe one center for each of them

TBD:
    think about how to store these features in a tensor or so
        so that they can be used in numpy+sckipy based graph ranking model
