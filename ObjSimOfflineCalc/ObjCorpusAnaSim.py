What I do:
    I generate obj-obj->score from corpus ana results
What's my input:
    a file, contains the pairwise cnt for target pairs
    a ctf file for obj ctf in facc | fakba 
    a score metric choice:
        default:    \frac{pair cnt}{obj a' ctf}
What's my output:
    a pickle dict, obj\tobj score (directed, a->b different with b->a, both should in dict)
